# Pruning_BERT
Structural Pruning and Block Movement Pruning replication from the Hugging Face block_movement repository and structural pruning for generative models paper. 

## This assignment is for the Advanced Natural Language Processing course. 

The assignment is for reproducing results from a paper published in ACL 2023 or ACL 2022. 
The paper I have chosen is from ACL 2023. The title of the paper is called Structured Pruning for Efficient Generative Pre-trained Model. The link of which can be found [here](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.692/)

The project contains the notebook and python files from the repository linked within the paper. 
My report which contains my attempt at re-implementing the pruning techniques mentioned in the paper and explored through the code can be found in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jEJC3IQGYaEny6s0lyYRMFO905jl54fg3sshvpw5yEw/edit?usp=sharing).
